##Programming Assignment 1 - Retnuh's Restaurant

In this assignment, you will be simulating the activities of a restaurant kitchen. See the specification in the companion pdf document. No starter code is provided.

You must give instructions as to how to compile your code. The resulting program must run by calling the following command:

```./RetnuhsRestaurant <input file name> (<output file name>)```

where <input file name> is the name of the rounds file provided to your program as input. If you choose to complete the second extra credit, then there is an optional second parameter (<output file name>) that represents the name of file to send output to.

In the course of testing your program, you may want to have a varied number of input files to test with. The attached program (`GenerateOutputFiles`) can create test input files for you. You may run the program with the following command:

```./GenerateOutputFiles (<number of files to generate>)```

where <number of files to generate> is an optional argument for the number of random test input files to generate. By default, the program generates one file. If you would like to see the source code, feel free to reach out to me (Simon Ayzman).
